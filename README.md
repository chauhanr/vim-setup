# Vim Setup 

This project is set up to help me set up Vim on a Linux box for my development needs. The tools that I need for the vim setup are: 

1. CtrlP 
2. NERDTree 
3. Vim-go 

This project has documentation links to all these tools as well as the .vimrc file that is needed to set this all up.
